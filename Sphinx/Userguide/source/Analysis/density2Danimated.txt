Purpose
=======

The 'density2Danimated' Python script is designed to create an animated 2D density plot from input data that represents 
the density of particles in the system. This script is a valuable tool for visualizing and analyzing spatial distribution 
patterns, and how they evolve over time.

Command to run
==============
::

    python3 analysisScripts/density2Danimated.py [dataname] [inputname] [start] [finish] [sliceDim] [sliceIndex] --myAspect [myAspect] --keepFrames [keepFrames] --normalise [normalise] --savePDF [savePDF] --defectData [defectData]

Most arguments are described in the :ref:`consistent arguments <ConsistentArguments>` section, except sliceDim, sliceIndex and normalise
Arguments preceded by -- are optional.

.. code-block:: console

    ``sliceDim``
    Dimension to 'slice' over for averaging. For example, for xy plane most likely we would use 'z' paramter.

    ``sliceIndex``
    Index of the plane to be sliced for averaging. Set the number of frames to skip between. If you want all frames to be plotted set 0.

    ``normalise``
    Normalise the colourbar on the right side.

Outputted files
===============
A video called 2Ddens_z0.mp4 will be outputted. If --savePDF is set to 1, every frame of the movie will be kept as a pdf file.
And if --keepFrames is set to one the .png frames won`t be deleted.
A screenshot of a typical movie is shown below.
