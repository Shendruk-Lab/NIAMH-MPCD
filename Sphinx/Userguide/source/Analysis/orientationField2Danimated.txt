Command to run
==============

::

    python3 analysisScripts/orientationField2Danimated.py [dataname] [inputname] [start] [finish] [avdim] --qx [qx] -- qy [qy] -c [length] -a [aspect ratio] -k [keep frames] -d [defect data]

Most arguments are described in the :ref:`common <ConsistentArguments>` section. The exceptions are as follows:

- ``qx``:
    (Optional, default ``1``) 
    How frequently to draw director arrows in the x direction.
- ``qy``:
    (Optional, default ``1``) 
    How frequently to draw director arrows in the y direction.
- ``length``:
    (Optional, default ``0.5``) 
    Length of the director lines.
- ``defect data``:
    (Optional, default ``""``) 
    Path to a topological charge field data file.
    If unset, or set to ``""``, then no defects will be drawn.
    Otherwise, attempt to load and then draw defects from file.

Outputted files
===============

A video called 2Dorientation_animation.mp4. 
If ``-k`` is set to 1, then every frame of the movie will be kept as a png file titled ``frameNNNN.png``.

For illustration purposes, the output of the script on a single simulation is shown below.
One snapshot is without defects rendered, and the other is with defects rendered.

.. list-table:: 
    :header-rows: 0
    :widths: 50 50
    :align: center

    * - .. figure:: ./orientationField.png
            :width: 95%
            :align: center
