Purpose
=======

This script produces a movie following the trajectory of swimmers and plots the fields in the fluid around them. This field can
be a velocity field, a vorticity field, or a nematic field.

Command to run
==============

::

    python3 analysisScripts/swimmerTraj_fields2D.py [dataname] [inputname] [start] [finish] [avdim] [fieldtype] --qx [qx] --qy [qy] -a [a] -k [k]

Most arguments are described in the :ref:`consistent arguments <ConsistentArguments>` section. The only ones that are not are fieldtype, qx, and qy`: they are described below.
Arguments preceded by - or -- are optional.

- ``fieldtype`` 
    Select which field to average. Can take three possible values: 'vel' for the velocity field, 'vort' for the vorticity field, or 'nem' for the nematic field.
- ``qx`` 
    Only show every qx arrow in x. Set to 1 by default.
- ``qy`` 
    Only show every qy arrow in y. Set to 1 by default.

Outputted files
===============

A video called swimmerVelField_animation.mp4, swimmerVorField_animation.mp4, or swimmerDirField_animation.mp4 will be outputted, depending on which
argument was given for 'fieldtype'. If -k is set to 1, every frame of the movie will be kept as a png file.

A screenshot of a typical movie is shown below.
