Command to run

    python3 analysisScripts/swimmerTraj_fields2D.py dataname inputname start finish qx qy avdim [fieldtype] -a -k

Most arguments are described in the :ref:`common <CommonArgument>` section. The only one that is not is fieldtype. 

.. code-block:: console

    fieldtype              Select which field to average. Can take three possible values: 'vel' for the velocity field, 'vort' for the vorticity field, or 'nem' for the nematic field.

Outputted files
===============

A video called swimmerVelField_animation.mp4, swimmerVorField_animation.mp4, or swimmerDirField_animation.mp4 will be outputted, depending on which
argument was given for 'fieldtype'. If -k is set to 1, every frame of the movie will be kept as a png file.

A screenshot of a typical movie is shown below.
