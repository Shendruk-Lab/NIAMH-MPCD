Developer's guide
#################

The MPCD code is well commented and it is expected that researchers will freely modify the code for their own purposes. 
To aid in this process, we have written a `developer guide <https://github.com/Shendruk-Lab/MPCD/blob/master/docs/DevGuide.md>`_, which is available on the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/Shendruk-Lab/MPCD>`_.
