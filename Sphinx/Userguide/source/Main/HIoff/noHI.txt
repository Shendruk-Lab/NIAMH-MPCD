Hydrodynamics can be turned off, which essentially creates a Langenvin dynamics simulation with a computationally costly Brownian thermostat. 
Though computationally costly, the benefit is that the material properties of the fluid are preserved. 
By turning them off, the role of hydrodynamic interactions can be probed. 

Hydrodynamic interactions are turned off by randomly exchanging the velocity of all fluid particles after  the collision collision step [Ali2004]_. 

To turn off hydrodynamic interactions, add the following to your input ``.json`` file:

.. code-block:: console 

    "noHI":         1,

.. figure:: HIoff/brownian.png
    :alt: Logo
    :scale: 30%
    :align: center

    Hydrodynamic interactions are "scrambled" by randomly exchange particle velocities.

If on the other hand a friction acts on the fluid (like a Brinkman term) (rather than ignoring hydrodynamic interactions), this can be set as a :ref:`damping friction coefficient <Damping>`.
