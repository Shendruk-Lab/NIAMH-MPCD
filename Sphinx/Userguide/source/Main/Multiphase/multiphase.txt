Multiphase fluids are implemented in this simulator by allowing for several species of particles with species-wide properties (mass, density, ...)
to coexist and interact through a tuneable interaction. The theory behind this interaction is described :ref:`here <landauGinz>`, and the broad lines
of the implementation in this algorithm are described in :ref:`the next section <MPImp>`.

.. _landauGinz:
Free-Energy of a multiphase fluid
=================================

A multi-phase mixture can be described by a Landau-Ginzburg free energy functional depending on the local compositional order parameter *ùúô*, 
a surface tension coefficient *ùúÖ*

.. math::
    F = \int d^d r (\frac{\tau}{2}\phi^2+\frac{b}{4}\phi^4+\frac{\kappa}{2}(\nabla \phi)^2) ,

where *d* is the number of dimensions in the system.

.. _MPImp:
Implementation in MPCD
======================

Multiphase models have been simulated in MPCD before using super-cells: close-by cells are grouped together, and a kick is given to particles based
on the gradient in compositional order between cells within the supercell [Eisenstecken2018]_. In this simulator, the surface of equilibrium compositional order is found
within each cell, and a kick is added on during the collision step [Koch2023]_.
