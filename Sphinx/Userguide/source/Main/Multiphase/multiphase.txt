Multiphase fluids are implemented in this simulator by allowing for several species of particles with species-wide properties (mass, density, ...)
to coexist and interact through a tuneable interaction. The theory behind this interaction is described :ref:`here <landauGinz>`, and the broad lines
of the implementation in this algorithm are described in :ref:`the next section <MPImp>`.

Free energy of a bimodal fluid
=================================

A multi-phase mixture can be described by a Landau-Ginzburg free energy functional depending on the local compositional order parameter *𝜙*, 
defined as

.. math::
    F = \int d^d r (\frac{\tau}{2}\phi^2+\frac{b}{4}\phi^4+\frac{\kappa}{2}(\nabla \phi)^2) ,

where *d* is the number of dimensions in the system, *b* and *τ* describe the bulk dynamic and phase separation, and *𝜅* is a surface tension 
coefficient [Cates2018]_. Minimising this free energy with the Euler-Lagrange equation reveals the equation of motion for the system.

Implementation in MPCD
======================

Bimodal models have been simulated in MPCD before using super-cells: close-by cells are grouped together, and a kick is given to particles based
on the gradient in compositional order between cells within the supercell [Eisenstecken2018]_. In this simulator, the surface of equilibrium 
compositional order is found within each cell, and a kick is added on during the collision step [Koch2023]_. This surface is defined by a 
quadratic equation, so that the gradient can be taken: this algorithm can therefore resolve surface tension effects up to the cell-length scale.

This method still works for N>=2 fluid species by running the same algorithm for each pair of 
species, and so a variety of multiphase fluids can be simulated.
