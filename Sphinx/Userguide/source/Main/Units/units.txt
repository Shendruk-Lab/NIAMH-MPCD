Measurements in this simulator are only relevant when compared to a few global values, described in section 4.3.1. In section 4.3.2, these units
are combined to describe the natural units of the other main observables. In order to compare results with experiments or to identify operating 
regimes, measurements can be combined into dimensionless numbers: this process is described in section 4.3.3.

Set values
===============

:math:`m`: Mass of a fluid particle, which sets the natural unit of mass. A fluid particle here means a discretized packet of fluid material. 
In multiphase fluids, the mass of different species can be set to be different: this will change the unit of most observables between species.

:math:`a`: Cell size, which sets the natural unit of length.

:math:`k_B T`: Temperature of the simulator's thermostat, i.e. the thermal energy of the system.

Since these define every other unit, they are set to one for convenience.

Derived units
=============

**Time**: Derived from the equipartition theorem: :math:`a\sqrt{\frac{m}{k_B T}}`. Hereafter referred to as [τ]. An important quantity it defines is
the timestep, dt, which is described in [SECTION ABOUT STREAMING].

**Velocity**: Length divided by time, so [v]= :math:`\sqrt{\frac{k_B T}{m}}`.

**Acceleration**: Velocity divided by time, so [a]= :math:`\frac{k_B T}{m a}`.

**Force**: Mass times acceleration, so [F]= :math:`\frac{k_B T}{a}`.

**Diffusion coefficient**: Length divided by time squared, so [D]= :math:`\frac{k_B T}{a m}`.

**Rotational diffusion coefficient**: Rotational diffusion coefficient divided by length squared, so [D :sub:`R`]= :math:`\frac{K_B T}{a^3 m}`.

**Spring constant**: Force divided by length, so [k] = :math:`\frac{k_B T}{a^2}`.

**Density**: Number of particles divided by cell size, so [ρ]= :math:`a^{-d}`, where d is the number of dimensions in the system.

**Pressure**: Force divided by length to the power of d-1, where d is the number of dimensions.
[P]= :math:`\frac{k_B T}{a^d}`. Streaming and collisional pressures are added together.

**Viscosity**: Pressure multiplied by time, so [μ] = :math:`\frac{\sqrt{k_B T m}}{a^{d-1}}`. Changing the timestep will result in a 
change in effective viscosity.

**Coupling to the mean free potential**: Energy divided by two space derivatives, so [K]= :math:`\frac{k_B T}{a^{d-2}}`.  

**Bending potential**: Bending energy divided by cosine squared of the bending angle, so [k :sub:`b`]= :math:`k_B T`. 

**Activity**: The unit of activity in this simulator is the same as the unit of force. Activity gives a contribution to the collision operator 
that is weighted by activity, the length of a timestep, and the mass of the particles. This results in units of force for the activity - see [kozhukhov2022]_
for more details. 

Dimensionless numbers
=====================

Dimensionless numbers allow the user to find out the regime at which the simulator is operating. This allows for comparisons to theoretical regimes
and to experiments.

The Reynolds number is an example of such a number. It broadly defines the ratio of inertia effects to viscous effects, and is obtained by multiplying
a typical lenght scale for the system (*L*) by a typical velocity (*v*) and the inverse of a typical viscosity (*μ*). 

.. math::
    Re=\frac{v L}{μ}

In classical mechanics, turbulence is a phenomenon occuring at high Reynolds number, where excess energy is dissipated by chaotic energy cascades. Active nematics can give rise to 
low-Reynolds turbulence: this important result can be recreated with this simulator.
