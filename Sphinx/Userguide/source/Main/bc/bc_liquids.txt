We can not only have partcies/liquids inside closed system. Like we have a 2D square system with absolute solid walls

But the boudaries also can be movable and interact with other boundaries and particles/liquids in the system.
The ones which are solid

Teh example configuration for this boundary looks like this

::

    "BC":
        [
            "inv":      0,
            "A":        [1,1,1,1],
            "P":        4,
            "Q":        [50, 50],
            "R":        1,
            "dsplc":    1,
        ]

inv parameter is necessary there, 0 indicates that particles should move outside the obstacle in the initialization. Dsplc parameter indicates that obstacle can be moved.

And the ones which can have particles/liquid inside.
If we want the liquid to be inside the obstacle we should set inv paramter to 1 can set species distribution to be inside the obstacle. An example configuration for it

::

    "species":
        [
            {
                "dens": 10,
                "mass": 1,
                "qDist": 2
            }
        ]
    "BC":
        [
            "inv":      1,
            "A":        [1,1,1],
            "P":        [2,2,2,2],
            "Q":        [50, 50],
            "R":        10,
            "dsplc":    1,
        ]

The inv 1 will make sure that particles will be inside our obstacle and qDist 2 will place all particles in the center of control volume.
