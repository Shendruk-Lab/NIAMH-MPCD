Colloids
------------------------

MPCD Colloids are implemented as boundaries that are able to translate and rotate in response to interactions with the fluid.
Mobile boundaries have temporally-dependent surface parameters :math:`\vec{Q}(t)` and :math:`\vec{A}(t)`. Translational and rotational motion are supported through the boundary's velocity and angular velocity properties :math:`\vec{v}_{b}(t)` and :math:`\vec{\omega}_{b}(t)`.

WRITE THE EVOLUTION EQUATION FOR HOW U AND L ARE UPDATED DUE TO PARTICLE INTERACTIONS.

Using the total boundary velocity and angular momentum, the surface equation :math:`S_b(\vec{x}(t),\vec{Q}(t),\vec{A}(t),t)` is updated at the end of the timestep.

.. warning::
    The current version only support mobile spherical colloids where :math:`\vec{A}(t) = \vec{A}(0)`.

Motion due to velocity BC

Motion due to orientation BC
-----------------------------

Describe the angular impulse conservation

Colloid streaming
-----------------------------

After resolving the colloid velocity and angular velocity, the colloid streams and rotates for time step.

This can lead to the colloid moving over particles or other colloids.
