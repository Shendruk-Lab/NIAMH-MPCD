Colloids
------------------------

Colloids are modelled as boundaries that are mobile.
What this means is the surface parameters Q and A have a temporal dependence.

The boundaries have a velocity and an angular velocity assocaited to them that can update Q and A.

Currently, we only use spherical colloids and for this, surface equations translate and rotate in time.
HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN?

In determining V and L, we assume that the particle boundary conditions
have conserved interactions (angular and linear momentum) at each point on the boundary.

Motion due to velocity BC
-----------------------------

Describe the impulse conservation

Resolving colloid velocity and angular velocity corrections at the boundary

Motion due to orientation BC
-----------------------------

Describe the angular impulse conservation

Resolving colloid velocity and angular velocity corrections at the boundary

Colloid streaming
-----------------------------

After resolving the colloid velocity and angular velocity, the colloid streams and rotates for time step.

This can lead to the colloid moving over particles or other colloids.
