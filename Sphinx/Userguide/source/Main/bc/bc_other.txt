Thermal boundary conditions
---------------------------

MPCD boundaries are able interact with the particles in natural physical way.
Depending on the collision type of the boundary

.. code-block:: console

    "BC":
    [
        {
            "colType":
        }
    ]

::

    colType: 
    0 - Respects all conservation laws by impact analysis.
    1 - Rule based collisions at the surface.
    2 - Probabilistic reflections at the surface.

If we have collision type 2 for boundaries - particles will draw random velocities from a thermal distribution.
All the interactions are based on KBT value. Tangential value of the velocity of the particle is being drawn from Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.
And the normal value is being drawn from Rayleigh distribution.
