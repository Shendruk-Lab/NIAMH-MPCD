All simulations require boundary conditions.
Creating surfaces to define the fluid control volume, establishes the fluid domain over which the hydrodynamic interactions take place.
For this algorithm, boundary conditions are applied directly to fluid particles that violate :ref:`surface equations <eq:bccondition>`.

The following steps are required:

- :ref:`Surface definitions <subsection_boundarysurfaces>`
- :ref:`Boundary condition rules <subsection_boundaryrules>`

These two processes can model a wide variety of fluid settings, including open systems (through periodic boundary conditions), channels and confinement in complex environments.
