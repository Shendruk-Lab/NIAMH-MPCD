.. _MPCD:

In many situtations in soft matter physics, the fluid medium in which mesoscale objects are suspended is crucial but not of principle interest. 
This is true of polymeric, colloidal or bacterial suspensions. 
In such cases, coarse-grained algorithms to simulate the surrounding fluid are needed. 
If, for example, the most significant effect of the fluid is to induce thermal fluctuations then a Langevin dynamics or Brownian dynamics algorithm would be most suitable [slater2009]_. 
If, on the other hand, the embedded objects are large enough that thermal fluctuations are negligible but hydrodynamic interactions between them are significant then an immersed boundary solver [mittel2005]_ or lattice-Boltzmann simulation [aidun2010]_ would be more appropriate. 

* If both fluctuations and hydrodynamic interactions are crucial then **MPCD** may be an appropriate technique. 

BENEFITS 
MPCD is well suited for situations involving relatively low Reynolds numbers---in which viscosity dominates over inertia---and moderate Peclet numbers---in which diffusion and advection are of similar significance. 
BCs, solutes, complex fluids

As in any computational approach, these benefits are counterbalanced by complications, including 

#. fluid properties (such as viscosity) are only controlled indirectly, 
#. multiple runs must be averaged to find statisticly meaningful results, and
#. compressibility. 




Particle-based coarse-graining
------------------------------

In MPCD the continuous fluid medium is discretised into point-like coarse-grained fluid particles. 
An equivalent view is that many atoms or molecules are grouped together and simulated as point-like fluid particles. 
This coarse-graning eschews molecular-scale details of the atoms and molecules that make up the fluid. 
Respecting conservation of these quantities is what allows the hydrodynamic equations of motion to be obeyed on sufficiently long length and time scales~\cite{**pooley05**}. 
Discretising the fluid into particle has the secondary effect of allowing MPCD to handle complicated boundaries more easily than methods that require complicated meshes.
