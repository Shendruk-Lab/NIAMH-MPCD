Particle initialization
=======================

.. _QDIST:

Position
--------
It specifies how the position of this species' particles is initialised. The available options are to :

- place the particles randomly and freely within the control volume. 
  Add the following to your input ``.json`` file: 

.. code-block:: json

    "qdist":         0,

- read the particles' positions from a file.
  Add the following to your input ``.json`` file:

.. code-block:: json

    "qdist":         1,

.. _note::

    The default value is 0.

.. _VDIST:

Velocity
--------

It specifies how the velocity of this species' particles is initialised. The available options are to :

- draw the velocity from an uniformly random distribution. To get uniform must consider from zero to :math:`(2 {\times} K_{B}T/MASS)^{1/2}` for each component. To get the negative velocity we make the interval twice as big and subtract off the original max. Add the following to your input ``.json`` file:

  .. code-block:: json

      "vdist":         0,

- read the particles' velocities from a file. Add the following to your input ``.json`` file:

  .. code-block:: json

      "vdist":         1,

- give all the particles the same initial speed but in different directions. Add the following to your input ``.json`` file:

  .. code-block:: json

      "vdist":         2,

- give all the particles the same initial speed along each axis in either direction.Add the following to your input ``.json`` file:

  .. code-block:: json

      "vdist":         3,

- draw the particles' velocity from a gaussian distribution scaled by :math:`(K_{B}T/MASS)^{1/2}`
  for each component of the velocity. Add the following to your input ``.json`` file:

  .. code-block:: json

      "vdist":         4,

.. _note::

    The default value is 0.

.. _MASSInitialization:

Mass
----

Mass of this species' particles. To set it, add the following to your input ``.json`` file:

  .. code-block:: console

      "mass":  <value>,

.. _note::

    The default value = 1 and it should be **always** be 1 for at least one species since it sets the mass scale .


.. _ODIST:

Orientation
-----------

It specifies how the direction of this species' particles is initialised. The available options are to :

- get a unit vector within a sphere distribution. 

  - 3D: Sample the z component on :math:`[{\cos(\pi)}, 1]` and then sample the azimuthal angle, :math:`{\phi}` on :math:`[0, 2{\pi})`.

  - 2D: Simply sample the azimuthal angle homogeneously.

  - 1D: Checks if :math:`{\cos(\phi)}` would be parallel or anti-parallel, returning +1.0 or -1.0.

  Add the following to your input ``.json`` file:

  .. code-block:: json

      "odist":         0,

- align all particles along X axis. Add the following to your input ``.json`` file:

  .. code-block:: json

      "odist":         1,

- align all particles along Y axis. Add the following to your input ``.json`` file:
 
  .. code-block:: json

      "odist":         2,

- align all particles along Z axis. Add the following to your input ``.json`` file: 
 
  .. code-block:: json

      "odist":         3,

- align all particles along 45 degree angle. Add the following to your input ``.json`` file: 
 
  .. code-block:: json

      "odist":         4,

- align all particles randomly within XY axis. Add the following to your input ``.json`` file: 
 
  .. code-block:: json

      "odist":         5,

- align all particles randomly within XZ axis. Add the following to your input ``.json`` file: 
 
  .. code-block:: json

      "odist":         6,

- align all particles randomly within YZ axis. Add the following to your input ``.json`` file: 
 
  .. code-block:: json

      "odist":         7,

- align all particles in the direction of origin towards positive right hand corner of any cartesian plane.
  Add the following to your input ``.json`` file: 
 
  .. code-block:: json 

      "odist":         8,

- align all particles in the direction of two oppositely charged defects.
  Add the following to your input ``.json`` file:
 
  .. code-block:: json 

      "odist":         9,

.. _note::

    The default value is 2.
