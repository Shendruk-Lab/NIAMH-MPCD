Analysis
########

In the root MPCD repository, we provide a series of scripts to help visualise simulations output by MPCD. 
These scripts are written in Python, and require Python 3, and required packages are included (``defectHandler.py``, ``shendrukGroupFormat.py``).

.. important::

  - The ``shendrukGroupFormat.py`` script is not included in the repository, but is available on the `Shendruk-Lab GitHub page <https://github.com/Shendruk-Lab/shendruk-group-style>`_. It requires a matplotlib style sheet to be installed. Follow the `readme instructions <https://github.com/Shendruk-Lab/shendruk-group-style/blob/main/README.md>`_ to install it.

  - If you choose not to use the ``shendrukGroupFormat.py`` script, you will need to comment out the call that imports it and modify rare lines that use it.

.. important::

  - Many of the scripts require ``ffmpeg`` to be installed on your system to produce movies. 
    If you do not have ``ffmpeg`` installed, you can still run the scripts, but they will not produce movies. 
    You can install ``ffmpeg`` using your system's package manager, or by downloading it from the `FFmpeg website <https://ffmpeg.org/download.html>`_. 

In this section, we briefly describe their usage.
Examples of their usage can be found in :ref:`the tutorials section <tutorials>`. 

.. note:: 
    These analysis scripts are provided primarily to quickly verify simulation output for first time users, and to give an example of how to parse MPCD's output files.
    Users are expected to develop their own analysis scripts appropriate for their own purposes.

Common
******

Most scripts make use of Python's ``argparse`` library to parse command line arguments.
Arguments have tried to be kept consistent between scripts, despite some differences in their usage.
Here, we briefly describe some common features

Help
====

In general, you can always give the ``--help`` (shorthand ``-h``) flag to any script to see a list of arguments and their usage.

For example:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python3 analysisScripts/orientationFieldAnimator.py -h

gives output

.. code-block:: console

    usage: orientationFieldAnimator.py [-h] [--qx QX] [--qy QY] [-c LENGTH] [-a MYASPECT] [-k KEEPFRAMES] [-d DEFECTDATA] dataname inputname start finish avdim

    Orientation field rendering script.

    positional arguments:
    dataname              Path to the data (should be directorfield.dat)
    inputname             Path to input .json file
    start                 Starting timestep for averaging
    finish                Finishing timestep for averaging
    avdim                 Dimension to 'slice' over

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    --qx QX               Only show every qx arrow in x
    --qy QY               Only show every qy arrow in y
    -c LENGTH, --length LENGTH
                          Length of director lines
    -a MYASPECT, --myAspect MYASPECT
                          'auto' or 'equal'
    -k KEEPFRAMES, --keepFrames KEEPFRAMES
                          0=don't keep (delete) frames; 1=keep frames
    -d DEFECTDATA, --defectData DEFECTDATA
                          Path to defect data (if any)

The output may vary depending on script, but will always be the most up-to-date description of the script's arguments.

Arguments preceded by -- are optional.

.. _ConsistentArguments:

Common arguments
================

The following arguments are (generally) consistent between scripts:

- ``dataname`` 
    Path to the input data file.
    Usually a ``.dat`` file.
    The exact file will vary from script to script.
- ``inputname`` 
    Path to the input ``.json`` file corresponding to the given data.
    This is used to read in simulation parameters.
- ``start`` 
    Starting timestep index for plotting.
- ``finish`` 
    Ending timestep index for plotting.
    Set to a very large number to plot until the end of the simulation.
- ``avdim`` 
    For scripts that will "slice" over a dimension, this is the slicing dimension.
    These scripts will average in this dimension, hence the name ``avdim``.
    Accepts ``"x"``, ``"y"``, or ``"z"``.
- ``-a``/ ``--myAspect`` 
    (Optional, default ``"auto"``)
    The aspect ratio to produce plots in. 
    Either ``"auto"`` for automatic aspect ratio, or ``"equal"`` for equal aspect ratio.
- ``-k``/ ``--keepFrames`` 
    (Optional, default ``0``)
    When producing frames for a movie, whether to keep the frames or delete them after the movie is produced.
    Set to ``1`` to keep the frames, and ``0`` to delete frames.
- ``-d``/ ``--defectData`` 
    (Optional, default ``None``)
    Path to defect data file, if any.
    This is used by some scripts to plot defects in the field.

- ``qx``:
    (Optional, default ``1``) 
    Only show every ``qx``-th spatial step in the :math:`\hat{x}` direction.

- ``qy``:
    (Optional, default ``1``) 
    Only show every ``qy``-th spatial step in the :math:`\hat{y}` direction.
