This is the userguide for the *NoIsy Algorithm for Mesoscale Hydrodynamics* (**NIAMH**). NIAMH is an open-source *Multi-Particle Collision Dynamics* (**MPCD**) code developed by the `Shendruk Lab <https://tnshendruk.com>`_ for simulating hydrodynamic interactions in complex fluids, such as colloidal suspensions, polymer solutions, and active matter. NIAMH-MPCD is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing users to easily add new features and customize the code to their specific needs.

This userguide provides installation guidance, tutorials and explanations of the algorithm.
It is primarily intended for users of the code, which is available from `GitHub <https://github.com/Shendruk-Lab/MPCD>`_, along with the `developer guide <https://github.com/Shendruk-Lab/MPCD/blob/master/docs/DevGuide.md>`_.
