Summary
#######

*NoIsy Algorithm for Mesoscale Hydrodynamics* (**NIAMH-MPCD**; pronounced 'neev-M.P.C.D') is an implementation of *Multi-Particle Collision Dynamics* (MPCD)---a coarse-grained, particle-based, numerical technique for simulating thermally fluctuating hydrodynamics within fluids. 
MPCD is ideal for situations involving moderate Peclet numbers, where diffusion and advection are of comparable significance. 

This implementation of MPCD is written in *C* and requires no external libraries. 
It is serial, because it is expected that numerical studies utilizing this code will invariably run many parallel instances to acquire statistical significance for stochastic processes. 
The code is versatile, able to simulate complex boundary conditions, polymer suspensions, nematic fluids, colloids, active fluids and swimming bacteria.
