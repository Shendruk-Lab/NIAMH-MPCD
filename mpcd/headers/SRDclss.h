   Boundary conditions take on a general form of
   ( (x-h)/a )^p + ((y-k)/b)^p + ((z-l)/c)^p = R^p
   which is in this code
   AINV[3] = (a,b,c)
   Q[3] = (h,l,l)
   ( A[0]*(x-Q[0]) )^P[0] + (A[1]*(y-Q[1]))^P[1] + (A[2]*(z-Q[2]))^P[2] - R^P[4] = 0
      PLANE    A=norm,p=1,R=-dist --- REMEMBER for a plane r must be neg!
      CIRCLE   A=[1,1,1] p=2, Q=centre, R=radius
      ELLIPSE  A=focii, p=2, Q=centre R=1
      SQUIRCLE A=1, p>=4, Q=centre, R=radius

	 There are additional complications:
	 (1) An absolute operator can be used around the terms
	 			abs( A[0]*(x-Q[0]) )^P[0] + abs(A[1]*(y-Q[1]))^P[1] + abs(A[2]*(z-Q[2]))^P[2] - R^P[4] = 0

	 (2) This only allows a certain subset of rotational symmetries (even and less than or equal to 4-fold).
	     For different symmetries, we have ROTSYMM[2]
			  Let r=sqrt( (x-Q[0])^2 + (y-Q[1])^2 + (z-Q[2])^2 )
				phi=atan2( (y-Q[1])/(x-Q[0]) )
				theta=arccos( (z-Q[2])/r )
		 	 	abs( A[0]*cos(ROTSYMM[0]*phi/4)*sin(ROTSYMM[1]*theta/4) )^P[0]
				 + abs( A[1]*cos(ROTSYMM[0]*phi/4)*sin(ROTSYMM[1]*theta/4) )^P[1]
					+ abs( A[2]*cos(ROTSYMM[0]*phi/4)*sin(ROTSYMM[1]*theta/4) )^P[2] - (R/r)^P[4] = 0
			This formulation allows us to make things like triangles, hexagons, stars
