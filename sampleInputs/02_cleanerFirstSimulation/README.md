This is exactly the same input as 01_FirstSimulation_PassiveIsotropic2D/input.json **but** is a much cleaner input file, that utilizes defaults and overrides for clarity.

Simulates 2D isotropic fluid in periodic boundic boundary conditions with no external forces, or solutes or anything interesting. Just a thermalized fluid to introduce how the input files work for first time users
