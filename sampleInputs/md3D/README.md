Simulates a single 3D polymer composed 6 monomers suspended in a nematic fluid all confined within an impermeable tube with perfect-slip boundary conditions on the velocity and planar anchoring on the nematic director of radius 4 aligned in the x-direction. The polymer is initialized in a self-avoiding random walk.
