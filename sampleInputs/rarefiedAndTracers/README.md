inputRarefied.inp
Simulates a very dilute system of only 6 particles in a 15x15 PBC box whose trajectories are outputted. This is meant to show the ballistic trajectories of particles when they form a dilute gas. 

inputTracers.inp
Simulates a normal fluid density (density=20), plus 6 tracer particles imbedded in the fluid whose trajectories are outputted. This is meant to show the diffusive trajectories of particles in an MPCD fluid.
