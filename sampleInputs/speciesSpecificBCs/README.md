Simulates 2D polymer translocation through a nano pore, with passive isotropic fluid on the cis side (top) and active nematic fluid on the trans side (bottom). Additionally, neither fluid can enter the nanopore but the polymer can. Specifying which fluid species interact with each wall is done by "interSRD". Likewise, "interMD" and "interSw" specify if monomers or swimmers see each wall.
