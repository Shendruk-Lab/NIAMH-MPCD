This is a simulation of only a single MPCD particle. It just travels ballistically in periodic boundary conditions. While you would never run a simulation like this or output the coordinates of every particle making up a fluid, you might include a species of MPCD particles with only a single particle (or a few particles) as tracers. In that case, you could use "trajSpecOut" and "trajOut" to track the tracer particles.
